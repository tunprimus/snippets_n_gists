def timeit_decorator(_func=None, *, repeat=3, number=1000, file=sys.stdout):
    """
    A decorator to measure and print time from best of `repeat` trials taken by a function.
    Mimics `timeit.repeat()`, but avg. time is printed.
    Returns function result and prints time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _func : callable, optional
        The function to be timed. If not provided, this function can be used as a decorator.
    repeat : int, optional
        The number of times to repeat the timing. Defaults to 3.
    number : int, optional
        The number of times to call the function in each repeat. Defaults to 1000.
    file : file-like, optional
        The file to write the results to. Defaults to sys.stdout.

    Returns
    -------
    A callable that wraps the original function and prints the timing results to the specified file.

    Examples
    --------
    from .timer import timeit_decorator

    >>> @timeit_decorator
    ... def f():
    ...     return "-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))
    >>> @timeit_decorator(number=100000)
    ... def g():
    ...     return "-".join(str(n) for n in range(10))
